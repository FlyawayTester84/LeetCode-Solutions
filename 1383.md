## Greedy Algorithm | Heap

Suppose we fix a minimum efficiency among all chosen engineers. Then it is optimal to pick the `k` engineers with maximum speed among all engineers with efficiency larger than minimum. Following this line of thought, we can construct our list of engineers from the maximum efficiency to minimum efficiency.

We first pick the engineer with maximum efficiency. Then we pick the engineer with next largest efficiency, and so on. If at some point our list of picked engineers exceed `k`, then we pop the engineer with smallest speed from the list. After each time we pick and pop engineers, we need to compare the current performance and update the maximum performance, if necessary.

Since we are popping the smallest element, it is good to use a heap to store the speed of all engineers picked.

The time complexity is $O(n\log n)$ (sorting the efficiency is $O(n\log n)$; picking the engineers is $O(k\log n)$.) The space complexity is $O(k).$

### Codes (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPerformance(self, n: int, s: List[int], e: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        efficiency = [[e[_], _] for _ in range(n)]
        efficiency.sort(key=itemgetter(0))
        
        select = []
        heapify(select)
        
        out = 0
        sumSpeed = 0 # total speed of selected engineers
        
        while len(efficiency):
            cur = efficiency.pop()
            heappush(select, s[cur[1]])
            sumSpeed = sumSpeed + s[cur[1]]
            if len(select) > k: 
            # if the number of selected engineers exceed k, we need to pop the one with smallest speed
                small = heappop(select)
                sumSpeed = sumSpeed - small
                # if the one with smallest speed happens to be the one with smallest efficiency, 
                # then there is no benefit to pick this engineer
                if small == s[cur[1]]: continue  
            out = max(out, sumSpeed * cur[0])
        
        return out % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```
