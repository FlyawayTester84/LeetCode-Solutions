1753 [Maximum Score From Removing Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-stones/)

## Combinatorics
Let's assume `a <= b <= c` after sorting. If `c <= a + b` then we can take `(b +  c - a) // 2` stones from each of pile `b` and pile `c` and then take `(c + a - b) // 2` stones from each of pile `a` and pile `c.` After these operations, pile `a` and pile `b` have the same number of stones, and pile `c` has at most 1 stone. Then we can take the rest of the stones from pile `a` and pile `b.` After these operations, there will be at most 1 stones left, so we have taken the maximum number of stones. Our total score is `(a + b + c) // 2.`

If `c >= a + b` then we take `a` stones from each of the piles `a` and `c` and `b` stones from each of the pile `b` and `c`. Our total score is `a + b`. This is the maximum we can get. Indeed, let's consider the total number of stones in piles `a` and `b` during the process. Each time we take two stones, at least one of them has to come from either `a` or `b`, so the total number of stones in piles `a` and `b` must decrease by at least 1. To maximize the number of stones taken, it is optimal to take exactly one stone from either `a` or `b` during each move.

### Codes (Python)
```python
def maximumScore(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
	piles = [a, b ,c]
	piles.sort()
	a, b, c = piles
	if c >= a + b: return a + b
	return (a+b+c) // 2
```
