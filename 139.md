139 [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/description/)

## Trie | Dynamic Programming
We first construct a Trie from the dictionary. Top-down recursive solution gives TLE, so we construct a `dp` array such that `dp[i]` is `True` if `s[i:]` can be break down and `False` otherwise. Note that `dp[i]` is `True` if and only if for some `j` such that `dp[j]` is `True` and `dp[i][j]` is a word in the Trie, or `dp[i:]` itself is a word.

### Code (Python)
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = defaultdict(TrieNode)
        self.isEnd = False

class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        trie = TrieNode()
        for w in wordDict:
            root = trie
            for c in w: root = root.children[c]
            root.isEnd = True

        dp = [0] * len(s) + [1] # dp[i] is the separability of s[i:]
        for i in range(len(s)-1, -1, -1):
            j = i
            root = trie
            while j < len(s):
                if s[j] not in root.children: break
                root = root.children[s[j]]
                j += 1
                if root.isEnd and dp[j]: 
                    dp[i] = 1
                    break
        return dp[0]
```
