## Dynamical Programming and Memoization
The number of 1 in the binary expression of $n$ is one more than the number of 1 in the binary expression of $n-2^k$ where $2^k\le n< 2^{k+1}$. This motivates us to use dynamical programming and memoization.

We divide the set of nonnegative integers by $[0,1), [1,2), [2,4),[4,8),\cdots,[2^k,2^{k+1}),\cdots$ and loop through each subset. This gives a solution without any built-in functions in $O(n)$ time complexity and $O(n)$ space complexity.

### Code (Python)
```python
def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
    out = [0]
    b = 1
    for j in range(30): # The constraint is less than 2^30
        for i in range(b): 
            if i + b > n: break
            out.append(out[i]+1)
        b *= 2
    return out
```
