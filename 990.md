## Union Find
Union find is a data structure that stores disjoint sets. It allows for two operations:

1. **Union**: Combine the sets containing given two elements.
2. **Find**: Find the set containing certain element.

The union find structure is implemented as a forest, with each tree representing a disjoint set. Each node stores its parent, and the parent of each root node is itself. In practice, the forest is represented as a dictionary. Keys are nodes and each value is the parent of corresponding key. 

### Code (Python)
```python
class disjointSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}
    
    # Finds the root node of a key. We move up the tree until we reach a root node.
    # This implementation is optimized as it flattens the tree. This is called path compression.
    # After each instance of find, all the nodes on the way are directly connected to the root node.
    # So find will be quicker in the next call
    def find(self, v):
        if self.parent[v] != v: self.parent[v] = self.find(self.parent[v])
        return self.parent[v]
    
    # To combine two sets, we just connect the root node of one set to the root node of the other set.
    def union(self, v, w):
        v = self.find(v)
        w = self.find(w)
        self.parent[w] = v
    
    # Makes a union find from a list or a set. Each element is in an individual set initially.
    def makeSet(self, l):
        for n in l: self.parent[n] = n
```

## Solution
Create a union find structure so that all variables that should be equal to each other are in the same disjoint set. Then we loop through the inequalities and return `False` if the variables on both sides of the inequality are in the same disjoint set.

### Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def equationsPossible(self, equations: List[str]) -> bool:
        var = set()
        for e in equations:
            var.add(e[0])
            var.add(e[-1])
        
        ds = disjointSet()
        ds.makeSet(var)
        
        for e in equations:
            if e[1] == '=':
                a = e[0]
                b = e[-1]
                ds.union(a, b)
        for e in equations:
            if e[1] == '!':
                a = ds.find(e[0])
                b = ds.find(e[-1])
                if a == b: return False
        return True
```
