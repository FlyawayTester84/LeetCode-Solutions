1975 [Maximum Matrix Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matrix-sum/)

## Greedy Algorithm
The matrix sum is maximized when there is a minimum number of negative cells. We make the following observations.

Suppose there are two adjacent cells with different sign. Then we can move the negative sign to the other cell by the operation.
```
[ -1 | 1 ] --> [ 1 | -1 ]
```
If there are two adjacent cells, both with negative signs, then we can cancel the negative signs.
```
[ -1 | -1 ] --> [ 1 | 1 ]
```
Finally, any cell with a 0 can absorb negative signs adjacent to it.
```
[ -1 | 0 ] --> [ 1 | 0 ]
```
The first two observations ensure that we can move all negative signs together and cancel them so that there is at most one left. Therefore, if there is an even number of negative signs, then the maximum matrix sum is just the absolute value sum of all elements in the matrix.

If there is an odd number of negative signs and, if there is at least one zero, then we can also cancel this negative sign by moving it next to 0 and using the third observation. The result is still the absolute value sum of all elements in the matrix.

Finally, if there is no zero entry and there is an odd number of negative signs, then the matrix sum is maximized if the negative sign is assigned to the element with least absolute value. Thus we need to subtract twice the absolute value of this element from the absolute value sum of all elements in the matrix.

### Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxMatrixSum(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total = 0       # absolute sum of matrix
        num_neg = 0     # number of negative entries
        num_zero = 0    # number of zeros
        m = 100000      # minimum absolute value
        n = len(matrix)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] > 0: total += matrix[i][j]
                elif matrix[i][j] < 0:
                    total -= matrix[i][j]
                    num_neg += 1
                else: num_zero += 1
                m = min(m, abs(matrix[i][j]))
        if num_neg % 2 and not num_zero: total -= 2*m
        return total
```
