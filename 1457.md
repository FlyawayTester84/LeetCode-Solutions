1457 [Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree/)

## DFS | Bitmask
The natural thought is to search every path from root to leaf by DFS. In the recursive step we need to pass the frequency of each digit to the children. It may appear that a dictionary is required, but since we have a range of digits between 0 and 9 and we only care about the number of each digit modulo 2, we can use a bitmask (which is only an int) to pass the frequencies. Eventually a path is pseudo-palindromic if and only if its bitmask is 0 or a power of 2.

Also note that recursion terminates when we reach a leaf, that is, **both** its left and right child is `NULL`. We cannot simply check if our current node is `NULL` since it may have a healthy sibling.

### Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def pseudoPalindromicPaths (self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        # check if a number is a power of 2
        def is2(n):
            num = n
            num |= num >> 1
            num |= num >> 2
            num |= num >> 4
            num |= num >> 8
            num = (num + 1) >> 1
            return num == n
        
        def dfs(root, mask):
            if not root: return 0
            mask ^= (1 << (root.val - 1)) # update the bitmask
            if not root.left and not root.right: return 1 if (not mask) or is2(mask) else 0 # terminate if we reach a leaf
            return dfs(root.left, mask) + dfs(root.right, mask) # recursive step
        
        return dfs(root, 0)
```
