2400 [Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-reach-a-position-after-exactly-k-steps/)
## Combinatorics
We need to move to the left for a total of `n = startPos - endPos` steps (if $n < 0$ then we are moving to the right for $-n$ steps). Suppose in the total of $k$ steps, $x$ steps are to the right and $y$ steps are to the left. Then
$$x + y = k$$
$$y - x = n.$$
This system of equations has an integer solution if and only if $n+k$ is even. In this case we need to distribute the $(n+k)/2$ right moves among $k$ moves, so there are $$\binom{k}{(n+k)/2}$$ 
choices in total.
## Recursion / Generating Function / DP
A natural way is to use recursion or dynamical programming since moving to a place $n$ in $k$ moves amounts to moving to $n-1$ in $k-1$ moves or moving to $n+1$ in $k-1$ moves. If we define $A(n,k)$ to be the number of ways to move from the origin to $n$ moves, this implies
$$A(n,k) = A(n-1,k-1) + A(n+1,k-1).$$
Also there are boundary conditions. We have $A(n,0)=\delta_{n0}$ and $A(n,k)=0$ if $|n|>k.$ This provides a basis for dynamical programming.

LeetCode sometimes judges Time Limit Exceeded for (badly-written) dynamical programming solutions. There is also a good way to derive the formula above only using this recursive relation. 

We define the generating function to be
$$f_k(x) =\sum_{n\in\mathbb Z} A(n,k)x^n.$$
It follows from the recursive relation that
$$f_k(x) = xf_{k-1}(x) + \dfrac1xf_{k-1}(x) =\bigl(x+\dfrac1x\bigr)f_{k-1}(x).$$
The boundary condition implies $f_0(x) = 1,$ so 
$$f_k(x) = \left(x+\frac1x\right)^k = \frac{(x^2+1)^k}{x^k}.$$
Now $A(n,k)$ is the coefficient before $x^n$ in $f_k(x),$ or the coefficient before $x^{n+k}$ in $(x^2+1)^k.$ Then the coefficient is $0$ if $n+k$ is odd, or if $n>k$ or $n<-k.$ Note that this coincides with our naive observation before. In all other cases, the coefficient is 
$$\binom{k}{(n+k)/2}$$ 
as before.

### Code (Python)
```python
from math import factorial
def numberOfWays(self, startPos: int, endPos: int, k: int) -> int:
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        n = abs(startPos-endPos)
        if n > k: return 0
        if (n + k) % 2 == 1: return 0
        h = (n+k)//2
        return (factorial(k) // (factorial(h) * factorial(k-h)))%M
```
