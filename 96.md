96 [Unique Binary Search Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-binary-search-trees/)

## Catalan Number
Let $C_n$ denote the answer for $n.$ Any node $i$ can be the root. In this case the left subtree is a BST from $1$ to $i-1$ and the right subtree is a BST from $i+1$ to $n.$ Then
$$C_n=\sum_{i+j=n-1}C_iC_j.$$
This is the Catalan number given by
$$C_n=\dfrac1{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}.$$

### Code (Python)
```python
def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int: return comb(2*n, n) // (n+1)
```
