600 [Non-negative Integers without Consecutive Ones](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-negative-integers-without-consecutive-ones/)

## Dynamical Programming
Let such integers be called *good* integers. We first consider the number of $k$-digit good integers (including leading zeros). Suppose there are $A(k)$ of them. Two initial conditions are $A(0)=1$ and $A(1)=2.$ (It is hard to visualize $0$-digit numbers, but this condition is indeed justified.)

Let's take a $k$-digit good integer where $k\ge2.$ If the highest bit of this number is 1, then the second highest bit is 0, and this integer with these two bits removed is a $(k-2)$-digit good integer. Similarly, if the highest bit of this number is 0, then this number with highest bit removed is a $(k-1)$-digit good integer. This argument gives
$$A(k)=A(k-1)+A(k-2).$$
Coincidentally, $A(k)$ is exactly the $k$-th Fibonacci number. Since any int has at most 31 digits, we can precalculate $A(k)$ up to $k=30.$
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393,
196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309]
```
Note that by a translation, `A[k]` is also the number of good integers in $[1,2^k].$

Now for general $n.$ Let's write $n$ in its binary form. Suppose $2^k\le n< 2^{k+1}.$ Either
```
n = 11...... (k+1 bits)
```
or
```
n = 10...... (k+1 bits)
```
In the first case, we divide $[1,n]$ into $[1,2^k], [2^k+1,2^k+2^{k-1})$ and $[2^k+2^{k-1},n].$ The first interval has `A[k]` good integers as before. For any number in the second interval, its highest bit is 1 and second highest bit is 0, so we can remove these two bits, and the second interval is actually the same as $[1,2^{k-1}),$ which has `A[k-1] - 1` good integers. 

In the second case, we divide $[1,n]$ into $[1,2^k]$ and $[2^k+1,n).$ The first interval has `A[k]` good integers as before. For the second interval, we find the second occurrence of 1 in the binary expression of $n,$ say $2^k+2^m\le n\le 2^k+2^{m+1}.$
```
n = 100...01...
           ^
        m-th bit
```
For any good integer in $[2^k+1,n),$ we can remove the leading `100...0` from $n$ and obtain a good integer of length $m.$ This reduces the problem to finding the number of good integers between $[1,n_0]$ where $n_0$ is $n$ with the leading `100...0` removed, or $n_0=n-2^k$. Then we can solve the problem recursively.

Don't forget to add 1 to the final result since we need the number of good integers between $[0,n].$

The overall time complexity is $O(\log n)$ and space complexity is $O(\log n).$

      num = bin(n)[2:]                # use string to perform slicing and keep track of number of digits
      out = 0
      while len(num):
          cur = 0
          if len(num) == 1:           # edge cases
              out += int(num)
              break
              
          out += ansPowers2[len(num)-1]

          if num[1] == '1':
              out += ansPowers2[len(num)-2]
              return out
          if num[1] == '0':
              i = 2
              while i < len(num) and num[i] == '0': i += 1
          num = num[i:]

      return out + 1
