1561 [Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-coins-you-can-get/)

## Greedy Algorithm
We sort the piles first. Each time we take the largest two piles and the smallest pile. 

Note that the order of taking piles actually doese not matter in the total count, so let's assume we take the largest pile in the first step. If we do not take the second largest pile of coins also in the first step, then we can rearrange so that we take the second largest pile of coins in the second step. Let's assume in the first step we take
$$a_1\ge a_2\ge a_3$$
coins, and in the second step we take 
$$b_1\ge b_2\ge b_3$$
coins, where $a_2\le b_1\le a_1.$ Then the total number of coins we can get is $a_2+b_2$ for these two steps.

Now let's consider an alternative. If $a_3\ge b_3,$ then we take $a_1\ge b_1\ge a_3$ in the first step and $a_2,b_2,b_3$ in the second step. Then $b_3$ is the smallest one in the second step since $b_2\ge b_3$ and $a_2\ge a_3\ge b_3.$ 

We also know $b_1\ge a_2$ and $b_1\ge b_2,$ so the total number of coins we can get is $b_1+\min(a_2,b_2)\ge a_2+b_2.$

If $a_3\le b_3,$ then we take $a_1\ge b_1\ge b_3$ in the first step and $a_2,b_2,a_3$ in the second step. Using the same argument, we can see that the total number of coins we can get is also not less than $a_2+b_2.$

From the arguments above, we can see that it never hurts to take the largest two piles in the first step. With a similar argument, we can also conclude that it never hurts to take the smallest pile in the first step.

### Code (Python)
```python
def maxCoins(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(piles)//3
    piles.sort()
    out = 0
    for i in range(n): out += piles[n+2*i]
    return out
```
