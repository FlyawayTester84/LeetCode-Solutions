2007 [Find Original Array From Doubled Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-original-array-from-doubled-array/)

## Hash Table | Greedy Algorithm
We sort the array first. The idea is to extract the original array as much as possible from the doubled array. As we iterate through the array, we make a dictionary of the frequencies of each entry. 

If we encounter an odd term, it can only be in the original array, so we add one to its frequency and attach it to the output array. 

If we encounter an even term, then either it is in the doubled array, or it is in the original array. If it is in the doubled array, then the half of this number must have appeared before (since the array is sorted), so we check the frequency dictionary. If there is match, we remove both numbers from the dictionary. If there is no match, it means that this number is in the original array and we attach it to the output.

Finally, if there are any unmatched terms in the dictionary, it means that the array is not a doubled array, so we return `[]`. Else we return the output array.

## Codes (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def findOriginalArray(self, c: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        dict = defaultdict(int)
        c.sort()
        out = []
        for i in range(len(c)):
            if c[i]%2: 
                dict[c[i]] += 1
                out.append(c[i])
            else:
                if c[i]//2 in dict: 
                    dict[c[i]//2] -= 1
                    if dict[c[i]//2] == 0: del dict[c[i]//2]
                else:
                    dict[c[i]] += 1
                    out.append(c[i])
        
        return [] if dict else out
```
