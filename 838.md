838 [Push Dominoes](https://leetcode.com/problems/push-dominoes/)

## Dynamic Programming
From the examples we can see that what matters are the distance between a domino and the closest `R` on its left, and the distance between the domino and the closest `L` on its right. Thus we can construct two arrays `dl` and `dr` such that `dl[i]` is the distance between the `i`-th domino and the closest `R` on its left. Similarly `dr[i]` is the distance between the `i`-th domino and the closest `L` on its right. This can be done by dynamic programming.

### Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def pushDominoes(self, dom):
        n = len(dom)
        dl = [0] * n
        dr = [0] * n
        # boundary conditions
        if dom[0] != 'R': dr[0] = n
        if dom[-1] != 'L':  dl[-1] = n
        
        for i in range(1,n):
            if dom[i] == 'R': dr[i] = 0
            # If an L is closer to the domino than any R on the left, then the domino 
            # will not be able to fall to the right, and we let the distance be the 
            # larget possible distance
            elif dom[i] == 'L': dr[i] = n
            else: dr[i] = min(dr[i-1]+1, n)
        
        for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
            if dom[i] == 'L': dl[i] = 0
            elif dom[i] == 'R': dl[i] = n
            else: dl[i] = min(dl[i+1]+1, n)
        
        ret = ""
        for i in range(n):
            if dl[i] > dr[i]: ret += 'R'
            elif dl[i] < dr[i]: ret += 'L'
            else: ret += '.'
        
        return ret
```
