1621 [Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sets-of-k-non-overlapping-line-segments/)

## Combinatorics
There are `n` points in total and we want to choose `2*k` of them as starting points and endpoints. There are `k-1` intervals that can be zero (adjacent starting points and endpoints can overlap). Then this becomes a typical stars and bars problem. We can add `k-1` points to the total number of points so that none of the points can overlap. The answer is the number of ways choosing `2*k` points from `n+k-1` points.
### Codes (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSets(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        return comb(n+k-1, 2*k)%(10**9 + 7)
```
