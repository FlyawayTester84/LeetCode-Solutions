948 [Bag of Tokens](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/)

## Greedy Algorithm | Deque
When we are playing a token face up, we might play the token with smallest value as well. When we are playing a token face down, we might play the token with largest value as well. Also it is best to play as many tokens face up as possible when we have enough to maximize score.

We can use a deque to keep track of both maximum and minimum of `token` after sorting. First we play as many as possible tokens face up until we ran out of power. If we don't have enough initial power to play even the smallest token, or there are no tokens at all, then we return 0.

Now we have a positive score. We play one largest token face down, and then continue to play smallest tokens face up until we ran out of power. This strategy ensures that at least we will not lose score after each round, so we always have at least one score to play next round. It also uses the power as efficiently as possible, so this strategy maximizes the score.

Also note that if there is only one token left and we do not have enough power to play it face up, according to the strategy above we should play it face down, but it is better to leave it there.

The time and space complexity of this strategy are dominated by the sorting step, so it has time complexity $O(n\log n)$ and space complexity $O(n)$ (depending on how the language implements the sorting algorithm).

### Code (Python)
```python
class Solution:
    def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], power: int) -> int:
        tokens.sort()
        t = deque(tokens)
        
        # initial conditions
        if len(t) == 0 or power < t[0]: return 0
        
        score = 0
        while len(t) and power >= t[0]: # don't play the last token according to strategy
        # play smallest tokens face up to gain some score using the initial power
            power -= t.popleft()
            score += 1
            
        while len(t) > 1:
            # play a largest token face down
            power += t.pop()
            score -= 1
            while len(t) and power >= t[0]:
                # play as many as possible smallest tokens face up
                power -= t.popleft()
                score += 1
        
        # only play the last token if we can play it face up
        if len(token) == 1 and power > t[0]: score += 1
        
        return score
```
