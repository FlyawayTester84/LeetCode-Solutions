1589 [Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-obtained-of-any-permutation/)

## Rearrangement Inequality
We find the frequency of each index and multiply the largest entry with the largest frequency. This is justified by the rearrangement inequality.

However, finding the frequency by brute force is justified Time Limit Exceeded by LeetCode. We need a more efficient way. Let's consider a graphical case
```
1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12
l <---------------> r
        l <-----------------------> r
                l <-------> r
                l <--------------------> r
```
The frequency of a certain index is the total times it appear between a pair of left limit and right limit. If we label each left limit by 1 and each right limit by -1, we can get
```
1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | -1 | 0 | -1 | 0 | -1 | -1
```
Note that we actually labeled -1 at `r + 1` since the right limit is included in the bounds. 

Furthermore, we can use a prefix sum to track how many left-right pairs we are in, which is exactly the frequency of an index. Each time we go past an `l` we are in one more left-right pair, and the prefix sum is increased by 1. Similarly each time we go past an `r` we are in one less left-right pair, and the prefix sum is decreased by 1.

Since we need to sort the lists, the time complexity is $O(n\log n)$ and space complexity is $O(n).$

### Code (Python)
```python
def maxSumRangeQuery(self, nums: List[int], requests: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    freq = [0 for i in range(n+1)]
    for l, r in requests:
        freq[l] += 1
        freq[r + 1] -= 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        freq[i] += freq[i - 1]
    weight = freq[0:n]
    weight.sort()
    nums.sort()
    out = 0
    for i in range(n):
        out = ( out + weight[i] * nums[i]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
    return out
```
